less administrative effort than NAT instances.

NAT Instance
A network address translation (NAT) instance is an Amazon Linux Amazon Machine Image
(AMI) that is designed to accept traffic from instances within a private subnet, translate the
source IP address to the public IP address of the NAT instance, and forward the traffic to the
IGW.

To allow instances within a private subnet to access Internet resources through the IGW via a
NAT instance, you must do the following:
Create a security group for the NAT with outbound rules that specify the needed Internet
resources by port, protocol, and IP address.
Launch an Amazon Linux NAT AMI as an instance in a public subnet and associate it
te an EIP and associate it with the NAT instance.
This configuration allows instances in private subnets to send outbound Internet
communication, but it prevents the instances from receiving inbound traffic initiated by
someone on the Internet.
